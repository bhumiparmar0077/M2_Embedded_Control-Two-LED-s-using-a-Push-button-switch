# Introduction
The push button switch is used to wind down on and the control circuit, and sort of control switch machine.Here we are going 
to figure out how to control the functioning of two LED's by utilizing a push button switch.

# Features
The main features of this project includes:-

•The push button switches comprises of two sorts – transient and non-passing and these switches are conventionally utilized in
adding machines, press buttons.

•Here,push button switch is attached to PB0 pin and pulled-up resistor which insure that while leaving the switch as not pressed,
the status of the PB0 pin should remain high.

# Swot analysis
## Strengths
•	The push buttons occupy less room in any machines or switchboard 
•The buttons are a lot firmer and simpler to utilize 
## Weakness
• Contacting the metal button switch also regularly can make its metal shrapnel lose its versatility and handicap the push on switch.
## Opportunities
•	Push buttons are utilized in enterprises, inferable from the solace and wellbeing in a few modern and business applications and it 
helps the representatives to control various parts of a machine.
## Threat
•	the push on switch can't produce works freely,and requires other PCB sheets to help out one another to frame a total switch control 
framework.
# 4W's and 1'H
**What** - push buttons can be associated together by a mechanical linkage so the demonstration of pressing one button makes the other
button be delivered. 

**When** - The press button switch is used to wind down on and the control led. 

**Why** - to control two LED’s using a push button switch.

**How** - first we will associate the 2 LEDs with PB2 and PB3 of PORTB of the microcontroller. A press button switch is then joined to PB0 
pin and pulled-up utilizing a 10K resistor. The excess terminal of the switch is grounded.
